# sql-injection
SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database. This occurs when untrusted input is included in a SQL query without proper validation or escaping, allowing malicious users to manipulate SQL statements and access, modify, or delete data.
